I am thouroughtly convinced with the above quote. Since childhood I was taught to be best in any field I foray into. I have wide spectrum of academic and professional experience in but not limited to electronic circuits, biomedical engineering, communication networks, computer vision, and information technology. As I start new opportunities in computer science being on par with the best of the best coder in the world is what I wish to be.

With this repo, I am going to solve new coding problems each day and I will track my coding skills each day. Ultimately I wish to be a Coding Ninja with the practice making me a better cs student, helping me crack coding rounds, and becoming a proficient developer.
